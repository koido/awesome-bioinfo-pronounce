# Awesome Bioinformatics Pronunciation Guide

This guide aims to provide the correct pronunciation for bioinformatics tools and databases, along with the evidence supporting each pronunciation.

Please note that the pronunciations provided in this repo might not always be definitive. In cases where there is no explicit evidence, the suggested pronunciation might not be accurate. Even pronunciations sourced from official websites may not always reflect the consensus within the broader community. Additionally, some terms may have established pronunciations based on convention rather than formal guidance. It is also possible for certain terms to have multiple accepted pronunciations. Users are encouraged to consider these nuances when referring to the database.
